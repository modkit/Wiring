  * This example demonstrates the TWI (I2C) "General Call" capabilities.
  *
  * General call is like a broadcast that can be received by many listeners at the same same. This
  * is useful when you don't know the address of the device you want to talk to or it can be used as
  * a sort of interrupt over the TWI (I2C). For more info on General Call, please see the I2C specs.
  *
  * The Wire library now supports General Call by adding a second receive callback to Wire.onReceive()
  * This second callback will be called whenever a message is received over the general call address.  
  *
  * 1) This code is for the slave device.  Connect the slave device (through usb) to your PC and open  
  *  up the serial monitor (set it to 9600 bps).  You can optionally connect two LEDs to pins 12 and 11
  *
  * 2) On the master device, connect a button between pin10 and ground and another between pin9 
  *  and ground.  The pin10 button will send its state to the general call address (can be picked up by 
  *  any attached slave device) and the pin9 button will sent through to a specific slave address. 
  * 
  * 3) Connect the SCL and SDA lines from the slave to the master.  For UNO boards SDA is on analog pin
  *  4 and SCL is on analog pin 5.
  *
  * 4) Pressing one button will send a message to general call and the other will send a message through 
  *  the slave's address.  Want to go further, add a second slave device and/or use the LEDs to see which
  *  address is being sent to.
